# 📦 Linux Package Updater
This is a very simple script made for those that are starting to use Debian-based Linux distributions, especifically Ubuntu.
## 📖 About the script
Not only uses all commands avaliable on Debian-based OS to check, install, upgrade and autoremove (delete no longer needed packages), it also updates or installs downloaded packages, which is way more comfortable than using the Snap Store that often glitches or when you need to upgrade you have to completly reinstall the package, this script avoids that.
## 🛠️ Setup
By default, the 2nd option (Search packages in Download folder), searches .deb and .tar files to install or upgrade the packages in the 'Downloads' folder, you may have to change this folder to addapt it to the folder you usually download stuff or change the name to other lenguage.
Give it launch permissions if necessary and select 'Open on Terminal' to launch it ot 'Show' to edit the Script. If you missclicked 'Open' the process will start on the background so you must kill it with the system monitor.
